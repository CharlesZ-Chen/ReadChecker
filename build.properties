# This is a dependence configuration file using by ant to build Read Checker
# (or generally a checker not inside in checker framework)
# Read Checker depends on checker framework and jsr308-langtools
# the default location of checker framework and jsr308-langtools is ReadChecker/../
# (This is the location where travis script would download and build these dependences)
# You could also configure to your own copy of these dependences
